## Issues

### Background sync

- [ ] [Refactor useEffect](src/providers/background-sync.tsx#L51). Works but needs to be cleaned up.
- [ ] Use cached results for search when offline.

### Filters

- [ ] Archived filter broken, API does not return archived from normal endpoint. Use `/api/bookmarks/archived/`.

### API

- [ ] Uploaded assets from API have a cold start, initially start with 404.
